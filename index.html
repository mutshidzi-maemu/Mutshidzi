  <!-- Expanded Literature Review -->
  <section id="literature">
    <h2>Literature Review</h2>
    <p>
      The issue of food security has been widely studied across various disciplines, including agriculture, social sciences, and information technology. 
      According to the <strong>Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO, 2023)</strong>, food security exists when all people have physical, social, and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs for an active and healthy life. 
      However, millions of households in developing regions continue to face food shortages due to economic instability, environmental changes, and limited agricultural knowledge.
    </p>

    <p>
      Studies by <strong>Devereux and Maxwell (2020)</strong> emphasize that food insecurity is not only a matter of production but also of distribution and accessibility. 
      Factors such as unemployment, poor infrastructure, and lack of farming resources often lead to low productivity and high dependency on external food sources. 
      The World Bank (2022) further highlights that empowering local farmers through education, digital tools, and access to markets can significantly reduce food vulnerability in marginalized communities.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the South African context, research by <strong>Statistics South Africa (2021)</strong> and the <strong>Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development (DALRRD, 2022)</strong> reveals that household food insecurity remains a challenge in rural provinces such as Limpopo and Eastern Cape. 
      Community garden initiatives have shown measurable improvements in food access and nutrition, especially when supported by training in modern farming and technology integration.
    </p>

    <p>
      The role of technology in agriculture ‚Äî often referred to as <strong>‚ÄúAgriTech‚Äù</strong> ‚Äî has gained prominence in recent years. 
      Innovations such as mobile farm management systems, automated irrigation, and digital crop monitoring have helped farmers make informed decisions about planting, fertilization, and harvesting. 
      According to <strong>Makhetha et al. (2023)</strong>, digital farm registration and data collection platforms play a vital role in improving planning, productivity, and traceability in small-scale farming.
    </p>

    <p>
      Previous studies also show that <strong>community involvement and collaboration</strong> are key to achieving long-term food security. 
      Projects such as the ‚ÄúOne Home, One Garden‚Äù campaign in South Africa demonstrate that small-scale gardens can significantly improve household nutrition and income if supported with training and monitoring. 
      Integrating these efforts with technology provides a sustainable model for growth and community empowerment.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      ‚ÄúTechnology and tradition are not opposites ‚Äî when combined, they can cultivate a future where every community thrives on innovation and sustainability.‚Äù üåø
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Therefore, this study builds upon existing research to explore how digital tools, data management systems, and collaborative platforms can enhance community-based food security projects. 
      The literature reveals that the integration of computing and agriculture is not only innovative but necessary for achieving long-term sustainability and resilience in the face of global challenges such as climate change and population growth.
